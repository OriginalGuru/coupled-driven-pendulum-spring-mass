# Exploration of interesting problems involving driven oscillators/pendulums
Summarize our exploration of interesting problems and simpler variants that we can use to orient our understand.

## Some interesting questions to explore
- How do we calculate the center of mass for a complicated object
  - ...and how do we approach this problem if it is not rigid?
- Can we understand and predict the dynamics of the driven rigid pendulum?
  - is there a closed-form solution?
- How do things change when the pendulum motion affects the driver's motion?
