# Exploration of interesting problems involving driven oscillators/pendulums
Summarize our exploration of interesting problems and simpler variants that we can use to orient our understand.

## Some interesting questions to explore
- How do we calculate the center of mass for a complicated object
  - ...and how do we approach this problem if it is not rigid?
- Can we understand and predict the dynamics of the driven rigid pendulum?
  - is there a closed-form solution?
- How do things change when the pendulum motion affects the driver's motion?

### Driven rigid pendulum
**What do we know about pendulum motion:** 
- Make strong statements about forces, _torques_, potential/kinetic energy
  - need to remind ourselves about polar coordinates and angular motion
  - $ \vec{F}_g = -m g\hat{y} $
  - $ \omega = 2\pi f = 2\pi/T $
- What do we remember about a pendulum
  - simple harmonic motion (_when?_)
    - **guess:** between $\pm 90^{\circ}$?
  - we expect that simple harmonic motion breaks down for large starting displacement of the pendulum
- Driven pendulum
  - [Video of driven rigid pendulum](https://sciencedemonstrations.fas.harvard.edu/search?search=inverted%20pendulum)
  - Seems dependent on driving frequency
